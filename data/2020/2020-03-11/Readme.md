In the first webinar you will learn about visualization principles by visualization experts being active in the SIG. In addition, we will discuss the first visualization to improve on. 

Please find below the timelines for the first cycle:

* Webinar to present the case study: **March 11th**. The **dataset can be accessed** [here](https://github.com/VIS-SIG/Wonderful-Wednesdays/tree/master/data/2020/2020-03-11)
* Timeline to submit improved visualizations: April 1st
* Webinar to provide feedback on the submitted visualizations: April 11th

# Psoriasis example data set

Psoriasis is a chronic relapsing disease of the skin characterized by variable clinical features. Skin lesions are characterized by prominent erythema, induration, and scaling. Plaque-type psoriasis is the most frequent clinical presentation. The pathophysiology of psoriasis is not fully understood but it is currently considered to be an immune-mediated disease. 

Accumulating evidence indicates that psoriasis is a multifactorial disorder caused by the concerted action of multiple disease genes, triggered by environmental factors. Genetic factors influence the pattern of psoriasis, its severity and the age of disease onset. Psoriasis cannot be cured, only controlled, and thus represents a lifelong burden.

# PASI as a primary endpoint 

Clinical response is typically defined and measured by Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI):

* Standard assessment in trials
* Range 0-72
* PASI>10 or >12 inclusion criteria
* Mean at baseline: ~20
* Very skewed distribution

As a dervied outcome:

* PASI75: at least 75% improvement from baseline
* PASI90: at least 90% improvement from baseline
* PASI100: 100% improvement from baseline

# The dataset

* Deidentified Subject Number: 1, …, 150 (= patient id)
* Blinded Treatment (N): 1, 2
* Blinded Treatment: “Blinded treatment 1”, “Blinded treatment 2”
* Analysis Visit (N): 3, …, 17
* Analysis Visit: “Week 1”, “Week 2”, “Week 4”, then every other 4 weeks up to “Week 52”
* Analysis Relative Day (N): 8, 15, 29, …, 356
* PASI100 Response Relative to Baseline: “Y”=Yes, “N”=No
* PASI90 Response Relative to Baseline: “Y”=Yes, “N”=No
* PASI75 Response Relative to Baseline: “Y”=Yes, “N”=No
* NRI Flag: “Y”=Yes, “N”=No; non-responder imputation, i.e. missing value is interpreted as “N”

# Timelines

* Webinar to present the case study: March 11th 2020. 
* Timeline to submit improved visualizations: April 1st 2020
